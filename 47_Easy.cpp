// 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word

/***************
Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
    Explanation:
    - "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
    - "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
    - "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
    - "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

Example 2:

Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
Output: 2
    Explanation:
    - "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
    - "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
    - "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

Example 3:
Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
Output: 3
    Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".

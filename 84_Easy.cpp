// 202. Happy Number

/***************
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true
    Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false

class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        bool happy = false;
        int count = 0;
        
        if(n == 1) return true;

        while(happy == false && count < 50)
        {
            int sum = 0;

            while(n > 0)
            {
                // one of the digit
                int last = n % 10;
                
                sum = sum + (last * last);

                // reduce the number
                n = n / 10;
            }

            if(sum == 1) happy = true;

            count += 1;
            n = sum;
        }
        return happy;
    }
};
